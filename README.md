1. Add the following line to your Gemfile:

2. And install:

3. Add this line to your app's `app/assets/stylesheets/store/all.css` manifest file, after all of
   the other spree requires (such as `require store/spree_core`):

        *= require store/spree_blue_theme

4. Optional: Clear out precompiled assets (required for install in sandbox):

        $ rake assets:clean
        $ rake assets:precompile
